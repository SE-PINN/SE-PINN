# SE-PINN

This is the official GitHub repository for _Solving the Schrödinger Equation via Physics-Informed Machine Learning_.

The research was in collaboration with Alexander Ahrens and under the supervision of Prof. Ipek Oguz (https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/ipek-oguz) at Vanderbilt University.
